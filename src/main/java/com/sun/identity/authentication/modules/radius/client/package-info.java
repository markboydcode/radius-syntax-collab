/**
 * Contains the authen classes that implement the radius protocol objects such as packets and their embedded attribute
 * fields. Additionally, a utility class, {@link com.sun.identity.authentication.modules.radius.client.PacketFactory},
 * translates the on-the-wire bytes into the representative java classes while those classes can generate the
 * on-the-wire representations when responding to requests.
